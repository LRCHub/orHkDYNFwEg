All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you,
be with you night and day
Nothing changes
on New Year's Day
I...will be with you again
I...will be with you again
<♪>
Under a blood-red sky
A crowd has gathered in
black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says
Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
<♪>
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
